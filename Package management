Package Management in linux  :- 
package management is a method of installing and maintaining (which includes updating and probably removing as well) software on the system.
programs were only distributed as source code, along with the required man pages, the necessary configuration files, and more.
Nowadays, most Linux distributors use by default pre-built programs or sets of programs called packages, 
which are presented to users ready for installation on that distribution.
However, one of the wonders of Linux is still the possibility to obtain source code of a program to be studied, improved, and compiled.

Yum:-
yum is the primary tool for getting, installing, deleting, querying, and managing Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
RPM software packages from official Red Hat software repositories, as well as other third-party repositories.
yum is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 5 and later. 

Some commands in YUM :-
yum install--Installs the specified packages
remove--Removes the specified packages
search--Searches package metadata for keywords
info--Lists description
update--Updates each package to the latest version
repolist--Lists repositories
history--Displays what has happened in past transactions
YUM provides many options for package management.
