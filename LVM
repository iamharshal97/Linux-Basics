VG	Volume Group	Pooled physical resources
LV	Logical Volume	Seen as a storage facility to the operating system.

Basic commonds of LVM :-

1) pvcreate -- to create a physical volume.
2) pvdisplay -- to display the physical volume. 
3) lvcreate -n name -L[size] name -- to create a logical volume.
4) lvdisplay -- to display the logical volume. 
5) vgcreate vgname[pv] -- to create a volume group. 
6) vgdisplay -- to display the volume group.
